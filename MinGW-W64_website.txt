1) At top of page, click the link, "Looking for the latest version? Download mingw-get-setup.exe (86.5 kB)".
2) Run "mingw-get-setup.exe" and click "Install".
3) Make note of where the folder "msys" will be downloaded to (default location is "C:\MinGW") and press "Continue".
2) In the "MinGW Installation Manager" window, in the colomn "Package", ONLY select "msys-base" by clicking it and selecting "Mark for Installation".
3) At the top left of window, select "Installation", "Apply Changes".
4) In the "Schedule of Pending Actions" window, select "Apply".
5) MSYS folder location will likely be "C:\MinGW\msys". Either leave it here or copy the "msys" folder where you wish.
NOTE: If you want a backup of MSYS for easier and faster installation next time, simply zip the entire "msys" folder.

DIRECT LINK (all files are split up, with MSYS as the root directory. it's way easier to just use "mingw-get-setup.exe" however.)
